The `typescript-tools` are an opinionated collection of utilities for working with
TypeScript monorepos.

## The Problem

Whereas [Lerna] was created for managing JavaScript monorepos, TypeScript monorepos have
additional requirements introduced by the compilation step.

The [original and reference implementation] of the `typescript-tools` is written in
TypeScript. The Rust implementation of the `typescript-tools` optimizes execution
speed.

## Goals

The goals of the typescript-tools are to give back the maximum amount of human time
possible; chiefly through stability and aggressive automation.

The Rust implementation aims to minimize the amount of latency added to your monorepo's
workflow.
